#First Package

This is the landing page for Jeff Bone's First Package. This package can be used to make basic manipulations to factors using 3 functions.

#Installation
To install simply type:
```{r}
#install.packages("FirstPackage")
library("FirstPackage")
```

#Example of fbind
fbind is used to bind two factors together
```{r}
#bind together basketball teams
factor1 <- factor(c("Spurs","Warriors"))
factor2 <- factor(c("Clippers","Thunder"))

fbind(factor1,factor2)
```

#Example of freq_out
freq_out creates a frequency table for factors.
```{r}
x <- factor(c("a","b","c","a","b","c","a","a","b"))
freq_out(x)
```

#Example of reorder_factor
reorder_factor reorders the levels of a factor based on their frequency. 
```{r}
y <- factor(c("Jeff","Jeff","Jeff","Adrian","Gal","Gal"))
y
reorder_factor(y)
```
